            "question": "Do you run schemes that are jointly managed?",
            "answer": "Yes, some schemes are operated jointly with partner organisations. A Management Committee may be established to address operational issues for these jointly managed schemes."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I join a scheme?",
            "answer": "Participants should choose schemes that fit their area of testing. Scheme descriptions and application forms are available, providing information about test materials and distribution dates. Participants complete the application form, select test materials, and receive an order confirmation. If test material availability changes, participants are kept informed."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can you guarantee my laboratory’s confidentiality?",
            "answer": "Yes, confidentiality is ensured by allocating a unique laboratory reference number to each participant. This number allows results to be reported without revealing laboratory identities. Only proficiency testing team staff and the laboratory itself will know this number."
          },
          {
            "question": "How often do I need to participate?",
            "answer": "Participation frequency depends on factors like other quality tools used, volume of work, and risk associated with measurements. LGC Standards offers flexible participation options, though some schemes have minimum levels. Regulatory bodies may recommend minimum participation levels. For trend analysis, participating in at least four rounds over a scheme year is generally recommended."
          },
          {
            "question": "What are the fees for participation?",
            "answer": "Fees are reviewed annually, and current fees are available on application. Payment terms are detailed on the application form and invoice. Delays in payments may result in withholding test materials or reports until payments are made."
          },
          {
            "question": "Where do you source your test materials?",
            "answer": "Most test materials are manufactured by LGC Standards. If not possible, test materials are carefully sourced to meet participant needs. Test materials are similar to those routinely tested by laboratories, but may be simulated matrices or concentrated spiking solutions to ensure homogeneity and stability."
          },
          {
            "question": "How are test materials packaged and transported?",
            "answer": "Test materials are packaged to protect contents during transit and sent using priority courier. Overseas customers must provide relevant documents for customs and may need to pay import duties. LGC Standards is not responsible for packages after delivery. Participants should check the contents immediately and contact LGC Standards if there are any issues."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I measure my laboratory’s performance over time?",
            "answer": "Trend analysis is used to measure performance over time. Frequent participation in PT schemes provides greater insight into long-term performance and identifies internal biases. Performance scores are best summarized graphically. For detailed guidance, refer to the Eurachem guide and ISO 13528."
          },
          {
            "question": "How will I receive my report?",

                "question": "Do you use Advisors and Advisory Groups?",
                "answer": "Yes, depending upon the scheme. Advisors are selected based on their technical knowledge and experience. They may be used on an ad-hoc basis or through formal Advisory Groups. These groups consist of experienced members in the field of testing covered by the PT scheme. Membership and terms of reference are agreed on a scheme-by-scheme basis."

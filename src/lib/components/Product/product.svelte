        Growing plant tissue in the laboratory may include seed, meristem, callus, and bud culture, and requires specialized plant culture media. 
        Murashige and Skoog (also called MS media, MSO, or MS0) and Gamborgâ€™s B5 medium are two of the most essential media formulations used for culturing plants. 
        These media contain all the micro- and macronutrients, vitamins, organic supplements, and plant growth regulators that are necessary for the growth and multiplication of plant cells, tissues, and organs in vitro. 
        For applications that require more custom formulations, we offer a comprehensive selection of basal salt mixtures, vitamin solutions, and supplements.
